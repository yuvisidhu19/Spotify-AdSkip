# Spotify-AdSkip
This python script will restart your spotify when an advert starts playing. When an advertisment is detected, this script will close spotify, open it again, play the next song and minimize spotify automatically. It will minimize the screen which is opened in front. So, I put a sleep timer of 3 seconds before it minimizes the front screen as it takes about 3 seconds for my computer to close and open spotify again. You can change the time accordingly. For better experience, you can use a '.pyw' file i.e. python file without console so that it keeps running in the background and another script to start spotify and the adskip script simultaneously.
